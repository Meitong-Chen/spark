# Exploring Spark and Climate Change

## Project Setup
This project utilizes Google’s Colab for setting up the Spark environment as per the provided setup instructions. The project involves implementing an end-to-end example using PySpark, detailed in a Spark reference guide.

## Project Overview: Climate Insights from Tasmania

### Background
This analysis is based on a hypothetical scenario where a steel vault in Tasmania collects data to guide post-apocalyptic societies about the potential end of human civilization due to climate change.

### Analysis Objectives

#### Temperature Data Exploration
- **Dataset**: Historical temperature data ranging from 1750 to 2015.
- **Tasks**:
  - Identify the country and year with the highest recorded temperature.
  - Determine the top 10 countries with the largest shifts in average temperatures over the recorded period.

#### CO2 Emissions Study
- **Integration**: Combine the temperature data with CO2 emissions data per capita from 1960 to 2014.
- **Analysis**:
  - Explore the correlation between CO2 emissions and changes in temperature over time.

### Technical Execution
- **Platforms Used**: Google’s Colab for initial analyses and Google Cloud for deploying a Spark job.
- **Cluster Configuration**: Document the process of setting up and managing a Spark cluster, including screenshots.
